# cql-worker
A library for executing Clinical Quality Language (CQL) expressions asynchronously via Web Workers. This allows web applications to evaluate CQL expressions in a non-blocking manner. For examples where this can be useful, see the Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention (ASBI) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) [Screening](https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-screening-app) and [Intervention](https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-intervention-app) apps.

## Underlying Technologies

### CQL Execution Engine
All CQL calculations are executed using the [CQL Execution Engine](https://github.com/cqframework/cql-execution), an open source library that implements the CQL standard.

### FHIRHelpers
[FHIRHelpers](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/wiki/FHIRHelpers) is a library that defines functions for converting between FHIR and CQL data types. `cql-worker` includes version `4.1.000` of FHIRHelpers, which is available under an Apache 2.0 License, Copyright 2014 The MITRE Corporation. Other versions of FHIRHelpers can be found [here](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/java/quick/src/main/resources/org/hl7/fhir).

### CQL Execution FHIR Data Source
The [`cql-exec-fhir`](https://github.com/cqframework/cql-exec-fhir) is used to provide a FHIR-based data source for use with the CQL Execution Engine.

### Web Workers
[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) provide a means to offload CQL expression calculations to a separate thread. 

## Current Limitations
This library has only been tested with [Webpack 4](https://v4.webpack.js.org/).

### Potential Future Improvements
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) supposedly has better support for Web Workers but also includes several breaking changes when it comes to bundling Node.js applications for the web browser. It may be possible to expand `cql-workers` so that it can support both Webpack 4 and Webpack 5.
- Node.js now includes support for [Worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html), which are similar to Web Workers but run in the Node.js environment. A possible future improvement could be expanding `cql-workers` to support Node.js Worker threads.

## Example Usage
```javascript
// See: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader
import Worker from "../../node_modules/cql-worker/src/cql.worker.js";
import { initialzieCqlWorker } from 'cql-worker';

// Define a web worker for evaluating CQL expressions
const cqlWorker = new Worker();

// Initialize the cql-worker
let [setupExecution, sendPatientBundle, evaluateExpression] = initialzieCqlWorker(cqlWorker);

// Define `elmJson`, `valueSetJson`, and `cqlParameters`

// Send the cqlWorker an initial message containing the ELM JSON representation of the CQL expressions
setupExecution(elmJson, valueSetJson, cqlParameters);

// Create `patientBundle` to hold the patient's FHIR resources

// Send the patient bundle to the CQL web worker
sendPatientBundle(patientBundle);

// Define `namedExpression`, a string containing the name of a CQL expression

let result = await evaluateExpression(namedExpression);
```

See the ASBI CDS [Screening](https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-screening-app) and [Intervention](https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-intervention-app) apps for additional information for how to configure Webpack to properly package `cql-worker`.
